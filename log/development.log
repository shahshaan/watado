Upgrading to energy-efficient appliances is one of many options to reduce utility costs and enable families to overcome this challenge. The US Department of Energy <a href=\"http://gr.pn/PxPkX7\">reports</a> that energy-efficient bulbs use up to 80% less energy to produce light than their traditional incandescent counterparts. Replacing 15 traditional bulbs with energy-saving bulbs can reduce electric costs by up to $50 per year for families.<p></p>\n\n<h4>The Campaign: Replacing Light Fixtures in Homes</h4>\n\n<p>If 50 people donate $10 to this Grassroots campaign, then Windy City Habitat for Humanity can replace 22 light fixtures in one home with new energy-efficient fixtures. Windy City Habitat for Humanity will replace the light fixtures within the 16-home West Pullman project. The efficient lights will help to reduce utility costs and keep the homes affordable for the low-income families living there. Each additional $23 raised will fund another energy-saving light bulb for a home within this project.<p></p>\n\n<p><em>Check out more Groupon Grassroots campaigns <a href=\"http://groupon.com/promos/grassroots\">here</a>.</em></p>","grid4ImageUrl":"https://s3.grouponcdn.com/images/site_images/2682/6856/RackMultipart20121024-3204-1svwjp2_grid_4.jpg","vip":"","soldQuantity":50,"isTipped":true,"finePrint":"100% of donations go directly to Windy City Habitat for Humanity.

Passes are received via mail, making them good for city-dwellers making their way to work as well as suburbanites looking for a way to get to events such as Lollapalooza, the Taste of Chicago, and more. Customers who do not have credit cards can buy the CTA 3-day pass with a Groupon gift card. Gift cards are available for purchase at Target, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel, and Dominick's. More info on gift cards can be found <a href=\"http://gr.pn/rq0ayy\">here</a>.<p></p>\n\n<h4>Chicago Transit Authority</h4>\n\n<p>Growling engines, beeping horns, and clattering train wheels are indelible sounds of Chicago's streets. And every day, more than one million travelers hear this din from inside the Chicago Transit Authority's <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtwjCS\">buses and trains</a>. The <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtwqOL\">intricate network</a> of interconnected train tracks and bus routes\u2014which once also included horse cars, trolleys, and streetcars\u2014composes the second-largest public-transportation system in the nation, a system that provides an average of 1.64 million rides per weekday around the city and surrounding suburbs.</p>\n\n<p>Buses zip along 140 routes, pausing periodically at bus shelters or blue-and-white street signs as an automated voice of reason announces each stop in a resonant baritone. The subterranean and elevated \"L\" train system, whose lines were once named for Saul Bellow characters, switched over to its simpler color-coded system in 1993. Today, for example, the orange line leads to Midway, the blue line takes travelers to O'Hare, the red line connects Wrigley Field and the White Sox's U.S. Cellular Field, and the brown line ambles to the famed Steppenwolf Theatre.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, the CTA has launched a series of <a href=\"http://gr.pn/Ntv2M0\">green initiatives</a>, which help conserve energy and cut up to 82 percent of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and other emissions. In addition to offering an alternative to rising gas prices and traffic, the CTA offers <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtuIwM\">LEED-certified headquarters</a>, dispatches fleets of hybrid buses and other <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtuK7Z\">efficient vehicles</a>, coordinates <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtuAxn\">recycling programs</a> for engine oil and batteries, and maintains a <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtwvSp\">bike-and-ride</a> system for cyclists who'd like lifts.</p>\n\n<p><p>\n<font size=\"2\"><center><i>By purchasing this Groupon and providing your name and shipping address, your order is complete.</i></center></font></p>","grid4ImageUrl":"https://s3.grouponcdn.com/images/site_images/2342/7955/IMAGE_CTA-3_grid_6_grid_6_grid_4.jpg","soldQuantity":25000,"isTipped":true,"endAt":"2012-12-01T05:59:59Z","mediumImageUrl":"https://s3.grouponcdn.com/images/site_images/2342/7955/IMAGE_CTA-3_grid_6_grid_6_profile.jpg","tippingPoint":1,"placementPriority":"nearby","isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"announcementTitle":"$9 for 3-Day CTA Pass","title":"$9 for a 3-Day Pass from the Chicago Transit Authority ($14 Value)","isTravelBookableDeal":false,"finePrint":"Limit 4 per person.

On this six-night trip to Rome with included round-trip airfare from New York, you can tour the Colosseum, located just a few Metro stops away from the plush <a href=\"http://www.hotelsantacostanzaroma.com/\">Hotel Santa Costanza</a>.

It\u2019s far enough away, though, to provide a quiet evening retreat. Head outside of the city and you\u2019ll quickly wind up on the GRA, a ring-shaped highway that surrounds Rome. From there, you can easily drive to other major Italian cities, such as Florence or Naples. </p>\n\n<p>The hotel\u2019s reception desk is open 24 hours a day to help you navigate the city, plan day trips, and purchase tickets.

Leeper shares the stories of disparate personalities, including a closeted man in the 1960s and a lesbian activist in the 1990s, with the aplomb and humor that earned the play the winning title of PFP\u2019s 2012 Great Gay Play and Musical Contest.

Upgrading to energy-efficient appliances is one of many options to reduce utility costs and enable families to overcome this challenge. The US Department of Energy <a href=\"http://gr.pn/PxPkX7\">reports</a> that energy-efficient bulbs use up to 80% less energy to produce light than their traditional incandescent counterparts. Replacing 15 traditional bulbs with energy-saving bulbs can reduce electric costs by up to $50 per year for families.<p></p>\n\n<h4>The Campaign: Replacing Light Fixtures in Homes</h4>\n\n<p>If 50 people donate $10 to this Grassroots campaign, then Windy City Habitat for Humanity can replace 22 light fixtures in one home with new energy-efficient fixtures. Windy City Habitat for Humanity will replace the light fixtures within the 16-home West Pullman project. The efficient lights will help to reduce utility costs and keep the homes affordable for the low-income families living there.

Get on the go with this Groupon.</p>\n\n<h4>$9 for a 3-Day CTA Pass ($14 Value)</h4>\n\n<p>The pass grants passengers unlimited rides within the city of Chicago and into nearby communities, accessible by the CTA's <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtwjCS\">system of trains and buses</a>, trackable online by <a href=\"http://gr.pn/MiRGp7\">computer</a> or phone. Passes are received via mail, making them good for city-dwellers making their way to work as well as suburbanites looking for a way to get to events such as Lollapalooza, the Taste of Chicago, and more. Customers who do not have credit cards can buy the CTA 3-day pass with a Groupon gift card. Gift cards are available for purchase at Target, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel, and Dominick's. More info on gift cards can be found <a href=\"http://gr.pn/rq0ayy\">here</a>.<p></p>\n\n<h4>Chicago Transit Authority</h4>\n\n<p>Growling engines, beeping horns, and clattering train wheels are indelible sounds of Chicago's streets. And every day, more than one million travelers hear this din from inside the Chicago Transit Authority's <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtwjCS\">buses and trains</a>. The <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtwqOL\">intricate network</a> of interconnected train tracks and bus routes\u2014which once also included horse cars, trolleys, and streetcars\u2014composes the second-largest public-transportation system in the nation, a system that provides an average of 1.64 million rides per weekday around the city and surrounding suburbs.</p>\n\n<p>Buses zip along 140 routes, pausing periodically at bus shelters or blue-and-white street signs as an automated voice of reason announces each stop in a resonant baritone. The subterranean and elevated \"L\" train system, whose lines were once named for Saul Bellow characters, switched over to its simpler color-coded system in 1993. Today, for example, the orange line leads to Midway, the blue line takes travelers to O'Hare, the red line connects Wrigley Field and the White Sox's U.S. Cellular Field, and the brown line ambles to the famed Steppenwolf Theatre.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, the CTA has launched a series of <a href=\"http://gr.pn/Ntv2M0\">green initiatives</a>, which help conserve energy and cut up to 82 percent of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and other emissions. In addition to offering an alternative to rising gas prices and traffic, the CTA offers <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtuIwM\">LEED-certified headquarters</a>, dispatches fleets of hybrid buses and other <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtuK7Z\">efficient vehicles</a>, coordinates <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtuAxn\">recycling programs</a> for engine oil and batteries, and maintains a <a href=\"http://gr.pn/NtwvSp\">bike-and-ride</a> system for cyclists who'd like lifts.</p>\n\n<p><p>\n<font size=\"2\"><center><i>By purchasing this Groupon and providing your name and shipping address, your order is complete.</i></center></font></p>","grid4ImageUrl":"https://s3.grouponcdn.com/images/site_images/2342/7955/IMAGE_CTA-3_grid_6_grid_6_grid_4.jpg","soldQuantity":25000,"isTipped":true,"endAt":"2012-12-01T05:59:59Z","mediumImageUrl":"https://s3.grouponcdn.com/images/site_images/2342/7955/IMAGE_CTA-3_grid_6_grid_6_profile.jpg","tippingPoint":1,"placementPriority":"nearby","isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"announcementTitle":"$9 for 3-Day CTA Pass","title":"$9 for a 3-Day Pass from the Chicago Transit Authority ($14 Value)","isTravelBookableDeal":false,"finePrint":"Limit 4 per person.

They came for the gladiatorial games, elaborate public spectacles wherein costumed warriors reenacted famous battles, animal hunts, and mythological dramas. On this six-night trip to Rome with included round-trip airfare from New York, you can tour the Colosseum, located just a few Metro stops away from the plush <a href=\"http://www.hotelsantacostanzaroma.com/\">Hotel Santa Costanza</a>. Click <a href=\"http://gr.pn/S6lBmD\">here</a> for more information on the trip.</p>\n\n<p>Located in the northeast quadrant of the city, the hotel is close to the city center\u2019s attractions, such as the 18-century Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon, built in 118 AD as a temple for the gods. It\u2019s far enough away, though, to provide a quiet evening retreat. Head outside of the city and you\u2019ll quickly wind up on the GRA, a ring-shaped highway that surrounds Rome. From there, you can easily drive to other major Italian cities, such as Florence or Naples. </p>\n\n<p>The hotel\u2019s reception desk is open 24 hours a day to help you navigate the city, plan day trips, and purchase tickets. Each morning, there\u2019s a complimentary buffet breakfast of traditional Italian coffee, homemade cakes, pastries, and croissants, and fresh fruit. Upstairs, in classic Italian-style <a href=\"http://gr.pn/T5f0tE\">guest rooms</a>, you\u2019ll find flat-screen satellite TVs, free WiFi, and bathrooms with marble accents. There\u2019s also an onsite bar and lounge, as well as a private inner garden that basks in the Mediterranean sunshine. </p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-to-great-value-rome#tabs-2\">Read the Fine Print</a> for important info on travel dates and other restrictions.</em></p>","merchant":{"ratings":[{"rating":4.0,"url":"http://www.expedia.com/Rome-Hotels-Santa-Costanza.h915133.Hotel-Information#reviews","linkText":"Expedia","id":"164904","reviewsCount":69},{"rating":3.6,"url":"http://www.hotels.com/ho204599/santa-costanza-rome-italy/#reviews","linkText":"Hotels.com","id":"164906","reviewsCount":52},{"rating":4.0,"url":"http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d253154-Reviews-Hotel_Santa_Costanza-Rome_Lazio.html","linkText":"TripAdvisor","id":"164907","reviewsCount":307}],"websiteUrl":"http://www.greatvaluevacations.com/packages/italy/rome/rome-city-groupon/PK-GC4P-RCG-FCO#?utm_source=Groupon&utm_medium=Non-bookable&utm_campaign=23Oct2012","name":"Italian Vacation with Airfare","id":"great-value-vacations"},"isOptionListComplete":true,"announcementTitle":"Six-Night Rome City Vacation with Airfare","textAd":{"line2":"","line1":"","headline":""},"isTipped":true,"endAt":"2012-11-03T03:59:59Z","dealTypes":[{"description":"For travelers who want to immerse themselves in the nightlife and culture of a big city","name":"Urban Retreat","id":"urban-retreat"},{"description":"For those in search of adventures in distant lands such as Thailand or Australia","name":"Far & Away","id":"far-away"},{"description":"International adventures led by an experienced guide, from African safaris to Outback expeditions","name":"Guided Travel","id":"guided-travel"}],"tags":[{"name":"Travel"},{"name":"Travel Agencies"},{"name":"Europe, Asia, Africa, & Oceania"}],"soldQuantityMessage":"150+","placementPriority":"nearby","shortAnnouncementTitle":"Rome Vacation with Airfare","grid6ImageUrl":"https://s3.grouponcdn.com/images/site_images/2671/0719/Global-Consolidated-Services-Inc-Sceptre_grid_6.jpg","uuid":"fdc48fa81c5a11e29a1200259060b356","id":"ga-to-great-value-rome","tippedAt":"2012-10-23T10:43:29Z","options":[{"initialQuantity":0,"discount":{"amount":40000,"currencyCode":"USD","formattedAmount":"$400.00"},"redemptionLocations":[{"state":"","streetAddress1":"Viale 21 Aprile, 4","lng":12.517996,"streetAddress2":"00162","country":"Italy","city":"Rome","postalCode":"-","phoneNumber":"","name":"Rome","id":4817756,"lat":41.9209814,"neighborhood":""}],"specificAttributes":{},"remainingQuantity":0,"value":{"amount":139900,"currencyCode":"USD","formattedAmount":"$1,399.00"},"isLimitedQuantity":true,"title":"Option 1: Valid for Wednesday departures, November 21\u2013December 5, 2012","soldQuantity":10,"expiresAt":"2012-11-03T03:59:59Z","isSoldOut":true,"details":[{"description":"Book by 11/2/12.

    <p>A lengthy lineup of traditional fare and a sportive atmosphere captivate flocks
    of fans at Fox and Hound, where the kitchen remains open as late as its neighboring
    fully stocked bar. Chefs chug away until the wee hours, baking Bavarian pretzel
    starters, crafting pickle-topped cheeseburger sliders, and assembling build-your-own
    platters of ribs and chicken. They blend their own flurry of seasonings to sprinkle
    over grilled-to-order burgers, and draw from a diverse roster of cheeses and toppings
    to crown their wood-oven-inspired pizzas.</p>


    <p>While manning the bars, drinksmiths tap into a teeming stash of libations,
    such as UV Whipped vodka and Patron Silver tequila, to mix their specialty cocktails.
    To further foster a jovial ambiance, TVs glow with sports games and custom music-video
    playlists, and guests partake in pastimes of ump denouncing, billiards, or competitive
    people watching.</p>'

    <h4>$2,899 for Laser-Only LASIK Eye Surgery for Both Eyes ($6,000 Value)</h4>


    <p>LASIK treatments can help address such visual deficiencies as near- and farsightedness
    and astigmatism. After leading a consult to confirm candidacy, the doctors schedule
    surgery, which begins with the IntraLase laser creating a small flap on the corneal
    surface. A laser then reshapes the curvature of the cornea under the flap according
    to calibrations customized for each patient. Next, the flap is replaced and allowed
    to fuse to the rest of the cornea, which doesn''t require any stitches or sutures.
    Eyes typically heal well enough for patients to see after one day, and many procedures
    result in 20/20 vision or better.<p></p>'

    or that blob in the basement. Keep things under control with this Groupon.  </p>


    <h4>Choose from Three Options</h4>


    <ul>

    <li>$25 for a haircut, blow-dry, and style (a $50 value)</li>

    <li>$79 for a Brazilian Blowout Zero treatment (a $300 value)</li>

    <li>$99 for a Brazilian Blowout Zero treatment with haircut, blow-dry, and style
    (a $350 value)<p></li>

    </ul>


    <p>The Brazilian Blowout Zero treatment smoothes rebellious strands with a formaldehyde-free
    formulation that creates a protective barrier around each follicle. Clients can
    also transform their tresses with a haircut before the stylist shapes locks into
    a complementing do with a blow-dry and style. For an additional $15, Groupon holders
    can add a conditioning treatment to the first option.<p></p>'

    <p>Pride Films and Plays brings writers together with stage and screen professionals,
    encouraging collaboration on exceptional pieces that address the nuances and issues
    of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community. During <em>At the Flash</em>,
    actor and cowriter David Leeper embodies five different characters over the course
    of as many decades. Leeper shares the stories of disparate personalities, including
    a closeted man in the 1960s and a lesbian activist in the 1990s, with the aplomb
    and humor that earned the play the winning title of PFP’s 2012 Great Gay Play
    and Musical Contest. The 20th anniversary production of <em>Beautiful Thing</em>,
    starring PFP ensemble member Michelle McKenzie-Voigt, takes Luna Central’s stage
    in January and February to weave the tale of a struggling working-class family
    on the outskirts of London. The world-premiere, true-life story <em>Under a Rainbow
    Flag</em> interlaces music and comedy to narrate the lives of gay soldiers in
    WWII.</p>'

    <h4>$75 for a Two-Hour Whiskey Workshop with Up to Ten Tastings ($150 Value)</h4>


    <p>In this comprehensive whiskey workshop, distillery ambassador Kristine Sherred
    goes beyond basic distinctions between rye and single malt to explain subtle variations
    of flavor. Kristine guides whiskey lovers through the spirit''s history, from
    traditional white rye to today''s high-rye bourbons, and presents both classic
    whiskeys and new-aged takes such as whiskeys distilled from millet, straight barley,
    and sorghum. Participants learn how to judge quality by discerning whether the
    distiller left in any “tails”—the bitter alcohol formed at the end of a distillation
    run. Students will also learn how the production process can express different
    qualities in the grain, reviewing both traditional and modern distilling methods.
    The workshop includes up to ten optional whiskey tastings, such as one of Koval’s
    <a href="http://gr.pn/Vpd1y5">white whiskeys</a> or the single-grain, single-barrel
    <a href="http://gr.pn/VpcZGq">Lion’s Pride whiskey</a>, and samples from craft
    distilleries from around the country. Workshops are held by reservation.<p></p>'

  pitchHtml: ! '<h4>The Issue: Housing Costs Causing Undue Burden</h4>


    <p>In 2010, 27% of households in the Chicago metropolitan area had a severe housing-cost
    burden—meaning they spent more than half their incomes on housing costs—according
    to <a href="http://www.nhc.org/media/files/Landscape2012.pdf">data</a> from the
    Center for Housing Policy. Upgrading to energy-efficient appliances is one of
    many options to reduce utility costs and enable families to overcome this challenge.
    The US Department of Energy <a href="http://gr.pn/PxPkX7">reports</a> that energy-efficient
    bulbs use up to 80% less energy to produce light than their traditional incandescent
    counterparts. Replacing 15 traditional bulbs with energy-saving bulbs can reduce
    electric costs by up to $50 per year for families.<p></p>


    <h4>The Campaign: Replacing Light Fixtures in Homes</h4>


    <p>If 50 people donate $10 to this Grassroots campaign, then Windy City Habitat
    for Humanity can replace 22 light fixtures in one home with new energy-efficient
    fixtures. Windy City Habitat for Humanity will replace the light fixtures within
    the 16-home West Pullman project. The efficient lights will help to reduce utility
    costs and keep the homes affordable for the low-income families living there.
    Each additional $23 raised will fund another energy-saving light bulb for a home
    within this project.<p></p>

      the end that the mouth doesn't go, then no thank you, sir!\" Here's why so many
      people are loving the clarinet:\r\n\r\n&bull; The clarinet has a warm, mellow
      tone, not like the trumpet, which just sounds like a big pile of garbage that's
      sitting there stinking it up but also making musical noises.<br>\r\n\r\n&bull;
      The clarinet is easy on the eyes, with all that straightness. That trumpet has
      sleek, alluring curves. You want kids looking at that? No, thank you.<br>\r\n\r\n&bull;
      You can take a clarinet apart. Can you take a trumpet apart? No, not just the
      mouthpiece. I'm talking about really taking it apart. You can do that to a good
      ol' woodstraw (a clarinet). Trust me.<br> \r\n\r\n&bull; There are dozens of
      famous clarinet players, such as Woody Allen and all those men that Woody Allen
      plays clarinet with. The only trumpet player who is remotely famous is the man
      whose life inspired the Broadway musical _The Music Man_, and he's probably
      dead.<br>"

      <p>&bull; The clarinet has a warm, mellow tone, not like the trumpet, which
      just sounds like a big pile of garbage that''s sitting there stinking it up
      but also making musical noises.<br></p>


      <p>&bull; The clarinet is easy on the eyes, with all that straightness. That
      trumpet has sleek, alluring curves. You want kids looking at that? No, thank
      you.<br></p>


      <p>&bull; You can take a clarinet apart. Can you take a trumpet apart? No, not
      just the mouthpiece. I''m talking about really taking it apart. You can do that
      to a good ol'' woodstraw (a clarinet). Trust me.<br> </p>


      <p>&bull; There are dozens of famous clarinet players, such as Woody Allen and
      all those men that Woody Allen plays clarinet with. The only trumpet player
      who is remotely famous is the man whose life inspired the Broadway musical <em>The
      Music Man</em>, and he''s probably dead.<br></p>'

    <h4>$9 for a 3-Day CTA Pass ($14 Value)</h4>


    <p>The pass grants passengers unlimited rides within the city of Chicago and into
    nearby communities, accessible by the CTA''s <a href="http://gr.pn/NtwjCS">system
    of trains and buses</a>, trackable online by <a href="http://gr.pn/MiRGp7">computer</a>
    or phone. Passes are received via mail, making them good for city-dwellers making
    their way to work as well as suburbanites looking for a way to get to events such
    as Lollapalooza, the Taste of Chicago, and more. Customers who do not have credit
    cards can buy the CTA 3-day pass with a Groupon gift card. Gift cards are available
    for purchase at Target, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel, and Dominick''s. More info on gift
    cards can be found <a href="http://gr.pn/rq0ayy">here</a>.<p></p>


    <h4>Chicago Transit Authority</h4>


    <p>Growling engines, beeping horns, and clattering train wheels are indelible
    sounds of Chicago''s streets. And every day, more than one million travelers hear
    this din from inside the Chicago Transit Authority''s <a href="http://gr.pn/NtwjCS">buses
    and trains</a>. The <a href="http://gr.pn/NtwqOL">intricate network</a> of interconnected
    train tracks and bus routes—which once also included horse cars, trolleys, and
    streetcars—composes the second-largest public-transportation system in the nation,
    a system that provides an average of 1.64 million rides per weekday around the
    city and surrounding suburbs.</p>


    <p>Buses zip along 140 routes, pausing periodically at bus shelters or blue-and-white
    street signs as an automated voice of reason announces each stop in a resonant
    baritone. The subterranean and elevated "L" train system, whose lines were once
    named for Saul Bellow characters, switched over to its simpler color-coded system
    in 1993. Today, for example, the orange line leads to Midway, the blue line takes
    travelers to O''Hare, the red line connects Wrigley Field and the White Sox''s
    U.S. Cellular Field, and the brown line ambles to the famed Steppenwolf Theatre.</p>


    <p>In recent years, the CTA has launched a series of <a href="http://gr.pn/Ntv2M0">green
    initiatives</a>, which help conserve energy and cut up to 82 percent of hydrocarbons,
    carbon monoxide, and other emissions. In addition to offering an alternative to
    rising gas prices and traffic, the CTA offers <a href="http://gr.pn/NtuIwM">LEED-certified
    headquarters</a>, dispatches fleets of hybrid buses and other <a href="http://gr.pn/NtuK7Z">efficient
    vehicles</a>, coordinates <a href="http://gr.pn/NtuAxn">recycling programs</a>
    for engine oil and batteries, and maintains a <a href="http://gr.pn/NtwvSp">bike-and-ride</a>
    system for cyclists who''d like lifts.</p>

  pitchHtml: ! '<h4>Ancient Ruins and Fabulous Food in the Eternal City</h4>


    <p>The famous Colosseum that stands in the heart of Rome was the largest ever
    built in the Roman Empire, once capable of seating 50,000 spectators. They came
    for the gladiatorial games, elaborate public spectacles wherein costumed warriors
    reenacted famous battles, animal hunts, and mythological dramas. On this six-night
    trip to Rome with included round-trip airfare from New York, you can tour the
    Colosseum, located just a few Metro stops away from the plush <a href="http://www.hotelsantacostanzaroma.com/">Hotel
    Santa Costanza</a>. Click <a href="http://gr.pn/S6lBmD">here</a> for more information
    on the trip.</p>


    <p>Located in the northeast quadrant of the city, the hotel is close to the city
    center’s attractions, such as the 18-century Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon,
    built in 118 AD as a temple for the gods. It’s far enough away, though, to provide
    a quiet evening retreat. Head outside of the city and you’ll quickly wind up on
    the GRA, a ring-shaped highway that surrounds Rome. From there, you can easily
    drive to other major Italian cities, such as Florence or Naples. </p>


    <p>The hotel’s reception desk is open 24 hours a day to help you navigate the
    city, plan day trips, and purchase tickets. Each morning, there’s a complimentary
    buffet breakfast of traditional Italian coffee, homemade cakes, pastries, and
    croissants, and fresh fruit. Upstairs, in classic Italian-style <a href="http://gr.pn/T5f0tE">guest
    rooms</a>, you’ll find flat-screen satellite TVs, free WiFi, and bathrooms with
    marble accents. There’s also an onsite bar and lounge, as well as a private inner
    garden that basks in the Mediterranean sunshine. </p>

    <h4>Triptych PhotoSplits</h4>


    <p>A wrapped canvas is a professional, photorealistic reproduction printed on
    textured artist canvas and gallery wrapped around a sturdy 1.5-inch edge. Thanks
    to its colorful flanks, a wrapped canvas doesn''t need to hide in a frame or rub
    lipstick on its edges every morning. With Triptych PhotoSplits, a single user-uploaded
    image prints in segments across three panels, which may be spaced out when hung
    to produce a stunning visual effect in any room. Customers may choose any image,
    but photos that lack close up images of people tend to work best, such as architecture,
    landscape, or nature photography.<p></p>


    <h5>Features</h5>


    <ul>

    <li>Single photo printed across three panels</li>

    <li>Professional reproduction</li>

    <li>$49 for an online bartending course plus $40 toward bartending accessories
    (a $114.99 total value)<p></li>

    </ul>


    <p>Each <a href="http://bartendingcollegeonline.com/faq.html">online course</a>
    guides the hands of aspiring barkeeps through a combination of 14 lessons, 16
    timed exams, and more than 50 drink-recipe videos, plus access to the recipe book
    with more than 100 drink recipes. Students work their way through the self-paced
    course, capping off the lesson with a genuine bartender''s certificate mailed
    to their home after passing the final exam. Students can opt to purchase accessories,
    such as a <a href="http://bartendingcollegeonline.com/signup.php">mixing kit</a>
    ($38.95), which equips future hooch-hawkers with all the tools for successful
    countertop alchemy, including a pint glass, large mixing tin, bar spoon, strainer,
    six pour spouts, a jigger, and instructions on how to nod sympathetically and
    pour a beer at the same time.<p></p>


    <p>The training course also includes access to the program on mobile devices.
    Students can use mobile devices to access lessons, videos optimized for mobile
    viewing, more than 100 recipes, bartender guides, quizzes, and newly added flash
    cards at no additional cost. Students can pull up drink recipes, study on the
    go, or take the test on their phones, which syncs progress across mobile devices
    and the online version. The mobile access works with most platforms, including
    iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone 7, and Symbian. </p>'

      <p>&bull; You can take a clarinet apart. Can you take a trumpet apart? No, not
      just the mouthpiece. I''m talking about really taking it apart. You can do that
      to a good ol'' woodstraw (a clarinet). Trust me.<br> </p>
